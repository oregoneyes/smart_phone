# smart_phone

The smrt_phone.R script reads in the smartphone data provided for the project. It combines the test and training data from all 30 test subjects. It modifies the activity vector to provide descriptive names. The original data set is subject to include all variable names with 'mean' and 'std' in their labels. This data set is red_sub_test and contains 88 variables and 10,299  observations grouped by test subject and then activity.

The red_sub_test was analysed further. Individual sensors readings for each test subject doing a particular activity were grouped together and a mean was calculated. The means were aggregated together under the sensor variable for each subject and each activity in the final data set called means_df. The means_df contains 88 variables and 2790 observations.
